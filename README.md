The file contains two cleaned data set and a file of raw text data. 
The raw data set was downloaded and it was in text form.
The raw data was imported and inputted manually into the sheet using the text functions "Left, Right, Mid, Concatenate, Find, Len" to manipulate the text-based data.
The data was sorted, filtered, and organized.
Blank column aand rows were removed.
The table was arranged in alphabetical order.
The table was then formatted imto a table using the table design of my choice.
